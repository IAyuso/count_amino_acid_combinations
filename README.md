# count_amino_acid_combinations

The script in this repository allows the user to specify positions in the alignment (by spefifying a name and the column position) and will output the number of sequences with that speficic configuration of amino acids in the data set

It will also get a list grouping all the accession numbers corresponding to a specific configuration of amino acids, for all the different configurations in the sequence space.
